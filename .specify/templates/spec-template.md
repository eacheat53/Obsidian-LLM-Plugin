# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze note content using AI services (text embeddings and LLMs) to identify related notes
- **FR-002**: System MUST recommend relevant note links based on semantic similarity calculations  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to configure API keys, model names, and similarity thresholds via settings panel
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist note embeddings and AI scores in a JSON file to avoid redundant calculations
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically inject relevant note links in [[WikiLink]] format into user's markdown files
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate and maintain unique note IDs in front-matter for stable data associations
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect note content changes via content hashing for efficient incremental updates
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide non-blocking progress feedback with cancellation option for long-running tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST run entirely within Obsidian's JavaScript environment without external dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific AI service APIs and their authentication methods?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Plugin successfully identifies and recommends relevant note links with 80%+ user satisfaction
- **SC-002**: System processes note similarity calculations for 1000 notes within 5 minutes on standard hardware
- **SC-003**: User can configure all necessary API settings via the settings panel without code changes
- **SC-004**: Plugin maintains responsive UI during background processing of AI tasks (no UI freezing)
- **SC-005**: Incremental updates detect and process only changed notes, reducing processing time by 90% for minor changes
- **SC-006**: All data (embeddings, scores, note IDs) persists reliably in JSON file format across plugin restarts
- **SC-007**: Progress dialog accurately reflects task completion percentage with option to cancel long operations
- **SC-008**: TypeScript code maintains strict type checking with comprehensive JSDoc documentation coverage
