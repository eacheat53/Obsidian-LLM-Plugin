# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.qwen/commands/speckit.plan.toml` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with strict type checking (ES2020+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Obsidian API, node-fetch for HTTP requests, uuid for ID generation  
**Storage**: JSON file-based persistence (single JSON file for embeddings/cache)  
**Testing**: Jest for unit testing, @testing-library for UI testing  
**Target Platform**: Obsidian Plugin Platform (desktop applications)  
**Project Type**: Single plugin project (TypeScript/JavaScript module)  
**Performance Goals**: Responsive UI during async operations, efficient note similarity calculations  
**Constraints**: Must run within Obsidian's sandbox, no external dependencies, limited memory usage  
**Scale/Scope**: Works with Obsidian vaults of up to 10k notes, efficient incremental updates

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This feature MUST comply with the Obsidian LLM Plugin Constitution:
- Self-contained, pure TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- Zero external dependencies (no Python, Go, Java runtimes)
- Single-process architecture with asynchronous operations
- Module design: api-service.ts, ai-logic-service.ts, cache-service.ts, link-injector-service.ts
- Unique IDs for notes in front-matter for data associations
- Content hash-based change detection for incremental updates
- Comprehensive settings panel for user configuration
- Non-blocking progress UI for long-running tasks
- Strict TypeScript with documentation

**Structure Decision**: Single plugin project following Obsidian plugin architecture with modular service design per constitution

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
